 # Real-Time Violence Detection
Real-Time Violence Detection (CNN-based CCTV Classification)
Developed a deep learning model to detect violent activity in CCTV footage using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

Preprocessed and augmented an image dataset with labeled "Violence" and "NonViolence" classes using ImageDataGenerator

Built a CNN with Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Dropout, and Dense layers using TensorFlow/Keras

Trained the model on a large dataset of CCTV frames, achieving ~99% validation accuracy

Visualized performance metrics and saved the trained model for real-time deployment (violence_model.h5)

Designed for smart-city applications such as surveillance monitoring and public safety
